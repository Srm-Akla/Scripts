# Some of my Scripts

### ild 
Stands for "interactive list display"(I know, not the best name), allows you to change directories easily on terminal.

### passwd_gen
Generates a password. Takes *password length* as commandline arument. \
**Syntax** -> ./passwd_gen 13 (generates a password of 13 letters)
#### Problem
- Does not generate key with length:2 or 1

### updt
Script that runs **update, upgrade, autoremove, autoclean**
